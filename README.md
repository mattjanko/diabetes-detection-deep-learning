**Project synopsis.** In this project, we develop a model for classifying individuals as diabetic and nondiabetic. We start with a baseline deep learning model and experiment with L2 regularization and dropout layers to control overfitting.

Repository contents:

* diabetes-detection.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook with our EDA, preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and discussion
* preprocessed.csv - a CSV with the preprocessed data we used to train the model (the full data is available from [https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/files/LLCP2015XPT.zip](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2015/files/LLCP2015XPT.zip)
* codebook15_llcp.pdf - the codebook explaining how to interpret each column in the raw data file
